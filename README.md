# Elysium
The purpose of the project is to create a minimal-setup, android controlled, multiplayer game in python. The game allows two users to connect to their laptop using their phone and play the classic "Space Invaders" with the fun twist of Multiplayer. 

It was created in the 24hr long hackathon Syntax Error conducted by SDS Labs - IITR.

# Setup
Main1.py is the standalone python file for the entire project. No extra installations, just one file to get started. On the android end, any simple third part android sensor can be used to connect to the game. Run main1.py and setup the android app to send data to the ip address and port the program is listening on (Typically, this can be done by connecting to the same hotspot)

# Note
Due to the dependency on third party android app, the portability of the project is limited. I intend on creating an android app to capture sensor data in the near future.
