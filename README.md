The purpose of the project is to create a minimal-setup, android controlled, multiplayer game. The game allows two users to connect to their laptop using their phone and play the classic "Space Invaders" with the fun twist of Multiplayer. 

The game allows for a smooth, engaging experience with friends.

# Setup
Main1.py is the standalone python file for the entire project. No extra installations, just one file to get started. On the android end, any simple third part android sensor can be used to connect to the game. 

# Challenges 
The primary challenges and hurdles were - 
. Handling data from two users at once
. Creating android app to send user data
. Running multiple linked threads
. Optimizing raw sensor data to provide smooth motion
. Optimizing game logic for multiplayer
